# vs-code-snippets
Some snippets for VSCode.

## How to install

- Clone the repo
- Copy the `.code-snippets` file in the project's `/.vscode` folder. Create it if it doesn't exist
- Restart vscode
- The keyboard shortcut is the `prefix` value.

## Further development
It's a just ome snippets I did, that I put out there in case someone else finds it useful, so I'm don't have big expansion plans beyond adding snippets for the next thing that I find makes me waste my time, and maybe a script to pull new snippets and add them automatically to VSCode

It doesn't have to be in Typescript, or for React ðŸ˜€
